            <p class="lead">Platform lifts can take a number of different forms, but they are usually used in low-rise buildings where they will only travel a few floors at most. This means they tend to move more slowly than passenger lifts and are often used for disabled access in buildings where most people will take the stairs</p>

            <p class="lead">Passenger lifts are designed to carry people and can come in a variety of forms. As these lifts carry passengers, they should meet specific requirements and standards to ensure that they are safe. They can come in a range of sizes, transporting different numbers of passengers.
              These lifts can be customised with different designs, both inside and outside of the cabin, so they can fit in with the design and style of the space around it. These lifts appear in a variety of settings, from shopping centres to private residences. They also tend to travel faster than other lift types as they are often used in high-rise buildings where passengers may be travelling through multiple floors.</p>

            <p class="lead">Glass lifts are a type of passenger lift that have glass walls and doors. They can be used in any situation that a regular passenger lift would be used in, but they can offer a stylish alternative. They are often chosen for their aesthetics and can provide a way of maintaining the style of a building whilst providing a means of transportation</p>

            <p class="lead">Dumb waiter lifts, also known as micro-lifts, food lifts or kitchen lifts, are used for transporting food or drink between floors. They are most commonly found within restaurants, bars, pubs, or within the homes of individuals with limited mobility. They are sometimes also installed in retail, office and medical environments.

              They were first invented in the 19th century, with the original meaning of the phrase indicating a device more akin to a serving tray. Dumb waiter lifts can be adjusted to suit premises which are restricted in terms of headroom and have problematic maintenance access and limited space.
              
              Dumbwaiter lifts can carry an average of 50-100 kg, and can move at 0.35 m/sec to serve up to six separate floors.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading  lh-1">(6)HYDRAULIC LIFT</h2>
            <p class="lead">A hydraulic lift is a type of machine that uses a hydraulic apparatus to lift or move objects using the force created when pressure is exerted on liquid in a piston. Force then produces "lift" and "work." Hydraulic lift technology has a multitude of industrial applications, like construction and transport. It is often implemented to operate heavy machinery or to move and lift heavy and large objects like cars, dirt and shipping containers.Hydraulic lift technology can be found in hydraulic jacks, forklifts, car lifts, among many other machines. Machines can use it to provide the lift exertion (force) needed to produce work, such as moving another object.Even automobile brakes use hydraulics. When you push the brake pedal, it pushes a small piston in the brake master cylinder. The piston applies pressure on the brake fluid, which transfers the pressure through the brake lines, forcing another set of pistons to force the brake linings into contact with the brake drums on each wheel. The resulting friction of brake lining against brake drum slows the car down, eventually stopping the car</p>

            <p class="lead">As the size of buildings are increasing, the need of elevators in all kinds of buildings have increased over sometime. Due to this, there have been many advancements in the manufacturing of elevators. Different technologies are being invented and used in making of elevators.

              Machine-room-less elevators are one of such innovations, more commonly known as the MRL elevators. MRL elevators are those elevators in which there is no need of a separate machine room on the roof of the elevator because the components are installed within the hoistway. Therefore, less space is required to install machine-room-less elevators.
              
              ERA Elevators is one of such MRL elevator manufacturers in India who have modified the conventional lifts in order to bring better lift solutions to the customers.
              
              ERA Elevators is a MRL elevator supplier that provides different MRL elevators with varying weight lifting capacity. Our customers can choose the MRL elevators that suits their requirements. Machine room less lifts can carry up to 16 people at a time. It can carry a weight up to 1088 kg. It also has a overload indicator that indicates if the weight inside the elevator has exceeded the maximum limit the elevator can carry.
              
              Speed is another factor that should be taken into consideration while selecting a lift for yourself. Elevators with varying speeds are available that can be used for travelling up to 30 storeys.</p>
